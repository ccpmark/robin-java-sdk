## Getting Started

Using the Robin API requires an API access token, which can be generated by logging in a https://dashboard.robinpowered.com.

Once you have an access token, you can instantiate the `RobinApi` class to easily make API calls:

```java
Credential credential = new AccessTokenCredential("my token");
RobinApi apiClient = new RobinApi(credential);

ApiResponse<List<Presence>> presence = apiClient.getService(PlacesService.class).getPresence(mySpaceId).getData();
```
